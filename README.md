# node-ioc-container
A small dependency injection container for Node.js quickly cobbled together after spending a little bit of time using require statements and realising that I could end up in dependency hell pretty quickly.

## Installing
node-ioc-container will be setup as an NPM package and when available will be installed via NPM.

## Usage

Suggested approach is to create a file called "dependencies.js" and in it map all of the dependencies your project has.
